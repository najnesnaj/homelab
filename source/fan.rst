modify fan speed in proliant
================================

After inserting a Tesla P100 GPU, which has no fan, I monitored the temperature using "nvtop". I noticed I went above 78 degrees celcius, causing it to throttle.


There is a method to change the ventilator speed in the BIOS. Switching it to performance is not a pleasent experience, as all fans turn at 100%.

Patch ILO
---------

turn out there is a patched ILO rom. There is a procedure where you have to set switch 1 of the maintenance switch on the systemboard. (next to powersupply)


.. code-block::bash: 
     
      rmmod hpsa 
      rmmod -f  hpilo
    
      follow the procedure to install the patched ilo-rom
      sudo ./flash_ilo4 --direct
      poweroff

switch 1 of maintenance switch back to 0

set fan speed
-------------

.. code-block::bash:

   ssh -o KexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -l Administrator 192.168.0.172

   fan t 0 adj -14  (this ajusts all fans)


Temp seems OK if fans are at 55%
